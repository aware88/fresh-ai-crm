# WithCar Email Solution - Simple Steps

## 🎯 What We Discovered

**The Problem**: Microsoft 365 has **disabled basic IMAP authentication** for `negozio@withcar.it`. This is why their previous customer could connect but we can't now - Microsoft changed their security policies.

**The Solution**: Use the licensed user `zarfin.jakupovic@withcar.si` to access the shared mailbox `negozio@withcar.it`.

## ✅ What I Already Did

1. ✅ **Cleaned up problematic entries** - Removed the broken `negozio@withcar.it` connection causing 404 errors
2. ✅ **Confirmed the issue** - Microsoft 365 blocks basic authentication (returns "Command failed")
3. ✅ **Set up the OAuth approach** - Configured the system to use licensed user access
4. ✅ **Created all necessary scripts** - Ready to fetch emails once connected

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Connect the Licensed User (Required)
1. **Open your CRM** in a web browser
2. **Go to Settings > Email Accounts**
3. **Click "Connect Microsoft Account"**
4. **Login with**: `zarfin.jakupovic@withcar.si`
5. **Enter the password** for this account
6. **Grant all permissions** when Microsoft asks
7. **Wait for confirmation** that the account is connected

### Step 2: Fetch Emails from Both Mailboxes
After Step 1 is complete, run:
```bash
npm run fetch:withcar-shared
```

This will:
- ✅ Access `zarfin.jakupovic@withcar.si` mailbox (licensed user)
- ✅ Access `negozio@withcar.it` mailbox (shared mailbox)
- ✅ Fetch emails from both
- ✅ Store them in your CRM database

## 🔧 Why This Works

**Microsoft's Rules**:
- ❌ Shared mailboxes cannot be accessed directly
- ❌ Basic IMAP authentication is disabled
- ✅ Licensed users can access shared mailboxes through OAuth
- ✅ One licensed user can access multiple mailboxes

**Your Setup**:
- `zarfin.jakupovic@withcar.si` = Licensed user (can authenticate)
- `negozio@withcar.it` = Shared mailbox (accessed through licensed user)

## 📞 If You Need Help with Step 1

**If you don't have the password for `zarfin.jakupovic@withcar.si`**:
1. Contact WithCar IT team
2. Ask them to provide the password OR
3. Ask them to connect the account themselves

**Alternative**: Ask WithCar IT to:
1. Create a new licensed user account for CRM access
2. Grant that account access to `negozio@withcar.it`
3. Provide you with the credentials

## 🎉 Expected Results

After completing both steps:
- ✅ You'll see both email accounts in CRM Settings > Email Accounts
- ✅ Emails from `negozio@withcar.it` will be in your CRM
- ✅ AI processing will work on customer emails
- ✅ You can send/receive emails through the system

## 🔄 Regular Email Fetching

Once set up, you can fetch new emails anytime with:
```bash
npm run fetch:withcar-shared
```

Or set up a scheduled job to run this automatically.

**Bottom Line**: The old method (email + password) doesn't work anymore because Microsoft changed their security. The new method (OAuth through licensed user) is actually more secure and reliable. You just need to connect the licensed user account first.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for you to complete Step 1
