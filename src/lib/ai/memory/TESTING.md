# AI Memory System Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document provides information about the test suite for the AI Memory System in Fresh AI CRM. The test suite uses Jest and provides comprehensive coverage of the `MemoryService` class functionality.

## Test Coverage

Current coverage metrics:
- Statement coverage: 89.04%
- Branch coverage: 80%
- Function coverage: 88.88%
- Line coverage: 89.55%

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
cd src/lib/ai/memory
npm test
```

To run tests with coverage report:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into several categories:

### 1. Basic CRUD Operations
- Creating memories with proper embedding generation
- Retrieving memories by ID
- Updating memory content and metadata
- Deleting memories

### 2. Semantic Search Functionality
- Searching for memories by content similarity
- Filtering search results by memory type
- Handling empty search results

### 3. Error Handling
- Database errors for all operations
- OpenAI API errors during embedding generation
- Proper error propagation and logging

### 4. Edge Cases
- Empty content in memories
- Very long content (10,000 characters)
- OpenAI client initialization failures

## Mock Implementation

The tests use several mocking strategies:

### Supabase Client Mocking
- Mocks the Supabase client with proper method chaining
- Implements mocks for `from()`, `insert()`, `select()`, `eq()`, `single()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `rpc()`
- Handles both success and error responses

### OpenAI Client Mocking
- Mocks the OpenAI embeddings API
- Tests fallback mechanism for when OpenAI client initialization fails
- Simulates API errors for error handling tests

### Environment Variables
- Uses test configuration from `test.config.cjs`
- Mocks environment variables for testing

## Test Helpers

The test suite uses helper functions from `test-helpers.cjs`:
- `generateTestMemory()` - Creates test memory objects with random content
- Utility functions for validation and data generation

## Future Test Improvements

Areas for future test expansion:
1. Integration testing with actual database schema
2. Performance testing with large numbers of memories
3. User permission and multi-tenant isolation tests
4. Memory relationships and connection tests

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- If tests fail with module import errors, ensure you're using CommonJS modules
- If OpenAI mocking fails, check that the mock implementation matches the current API structure
- For Supabase method chaining issues, verify that all required methods are properly mocked
