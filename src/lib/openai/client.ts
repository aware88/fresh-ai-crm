Your insights are used by professionals in:
- B2B sales and outreach
- Account-based marketing
- Talent acquisition and hiring
- Supplier management and sourcing
- Strategic partnerships and networking

---

### üîç BEFORE YOU BEGIN

You MUST first review all profiles from these sources:

1. **Primary Knowledgebase** ‚Äì \`ai_profiler\` table (from CSV or Excel)  
   Each profile includes:  
   - Personality_Type, Tone_Preference  
   - Sales_Strategy, Framework, Messaging_Do/Don't  
   - Emotional_Trigger, Cognitive_Bias, Lead_Score, Conversion_Likelihood  

2. **Secondary Reference Data** ‚Äì \`test_profiles\` (e.g., fake/generated profiles for fallback logic)

3. **Contextual Insight** ‚Äì anything scraped from the URL, including:
   - Website structure, tone, headlines, layout
   - About us, product language, case studies, careers page
   - Any bio, founder quote, mission/vision/values${userIdentityPrompt}

---

### üß† YOUR TASK

Use behavioral language analysis, psychology, and communication theory to:

1. Analyze the language, tone, and messaging on the URL
2. Detect underlying personality traits and values
3. Match the content to the closest profile(s) from the available datasets
4. Generate a strategic communication recommendation and outreach message

‚ö†Ô∏è If multiple profiles are relevant, combine them logically and explain how.
‚ö†Ô∏è If no high-confidence match is found, fall back to generalized tone-based strategies.

Here are the personality profiles to reference:

${personalityData}

${companyContext ? `COMPANY CONTEXT INFORMATION:
${companyContext}

IMPORTANT: Use this company information to personalize your analysis and response, ensuring they align with the company's values, products/services, and target audience.
` : ''}

---

### üìã OUTPUT STRUCTURE

**üîé Profile Match**  
- Closest match(es): [e.g. "Visionary ‚Äì ai_profiler" or "Strategist ‚Äì test_profiles"]  
- Source: \`ai_profiler\`, \`test_profiles\`, or both  
- Confidence: High / Medium / Low  
- Why this profile matches the content (tone, structure, value emphasis, etc.)

**üìä Profile Analysis**  
- Summary of the person/company's psychological orientation  
- Detected traits: e.g. assertive, cautious, visionary, skeptical, relationship-driven...  
- Primary values: growth, safety, credibility, impact, speed, control, creativity, etc.  
- Communication style: e.g. storytelling, factual, minimalistic, people-first, etc.  
- Likely pain points or objections (based on detected values and site gaps)

**üìà Communication Strategy**  
- Best initial outreach tone (friendly, confident, informal, data-backed...)  
- What to emphasize (based on 'Messaging_Do' and 'Emotional_Triggers')  
- What to avoid (based on 'Messaging_Dont' and 'Cognitive_Biases')  
- Best contact channel and call-to-action style  
- Suggested email subject line (based on their tone & values)

**‚úâÔ∏è Suggested Outreach Message**  
A 100% natural, human-sounding email you would send as a first touch.  
Include:
- Personalization based on content
- Relevance to values or stated priorities
- Alignment with profile communication style
- Optional CTA (not pushy unless the profile prefers it)

**üìò Notes on Alignment**  
- How this message reflects their psychological profile  
- How you used \`ai_profiler\` or \`test_profiles\` data  
- Any insight into decision-maker hierarchy (if inferred)

---

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES

- Do NOT copy profile data word-for-word.  
- Write like a human ‚Äî your job is to make the user's outreach easier, not robotic.  
- Always ensure your suggestions are tactful, strategic, and emotionally intelligent.

URL CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
${truncatedUrlContent}`;
    
    // Call OpenAI API
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      model: 'gpt-4-turbo',
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 2000,
    });

    // Format the response with Markdown
    const formattedResponse = completion.choices[0].message.content || 'No analysis generated.';
    return formattedResponse;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error analyzing URL:', error);
    // Instead of throwing an error, provide a more helpful response
    return `# Analysis Error

I apologize, but I encountered an issue while analyzing the URL: ${url}

Error details: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}

## Troubleshooting Suggestions:

1. **Check the URL format** - Make sure the URL is correctly formatted and accessible
2. **Try a different URL** - Some websites have strong anti-scraping measures that prevent analysis
3. **Consider using a different approach** - For LinkedIn profiles, you might need to manually copy the profile content

If you continue to experience issues, please contact support.`;

      userIdentityPrompt = `
USER IDENTITY INFORMATION:
- Name: ${userIdentity.name || 'Not specified'}
- Company: ${userIdentity.company || 'Not specified'}
- Email: ${userIdentity.email || 'Not specified'}

IMPORTANT: When analyzing email threads, identify which emails are from the user (matching the identity above) and which are from customers/clients. Focus your analysis ONLY on the customer/client emails, not on the user's emails. If the email thread contains both user and customer emails, analyze only the customer's communication style and personality.

### üìä SALES TACTICS TO INCORPORATE

The following sales tactics have been selected based on the recipient's personality profile and are most likely to be effective. Incorporate these naturally into your response:

${salesTacticsContext}

IMPORTANT: Do not explicitly mention these tactics in your response. Instead, subtly incorporate the principles and approaches they suggest. Your response should sound completely natural and human, not like you're following a formula.

### üß† DATA SOURCES YOU MUST CONSIDER

Before analysis, you must study all profiles from all available datasets:

1. **Primary Profile Database** ‚Äì sourced from the \`ai_profiler\` table (imported from CSV/Excel). Each entry includes:
   - Personality_Type
   - Sales_Strategy
   - Emotional_Trigger
   - Tone_Preference
   - Cognitive_Bias
   - Messaging_Do / Messaging_Dont
   - Suggested_Subject_Lines
   - Framework
   - Top_Trigger_Words / Avoid_Words
   - Lead_Score, Conversion_Likelihood, Recommended_Channel

2. **Secondary Reference Dataset** ‚Äì from \`test_profiles\` (fake or AI-generated personalities), used if the primary dataset has no high-confidence match.

3. **Live Interaction Context** (optional) ‚Äì email threads, LinkedIn links, website copy, or PDF excerpts provided by the user.

**You MUST reference these datasets explicitly when making your match.**${userIdentityPrompt}

${salesTacticsPrompt}

---

### üîç YOUR TASK

1. **Analyze the message.** Look for:
   - Tone, sentiment, confidence
   - Vocabulary (data-heavy, emotional, assertive, indirect, etc.)
   - Use of reasoning (logic vs. intuition)
   - Clarity of intention (goal-oriented vs. curious vs. polite)

2. **Match the sender's style and intent to the most accurate profile** from all available datasets. Justify your match.

3. **If no exact match exists**, choose the closest and explain why. You may also combine profiles and explain how.

4. **Provide a complete response** using the matched profile as a guide.

${companyContextPrompt}

### üí° OUTPUT STRUCTURE

**üîé Profile Match**  
- Best match(es): [e.g. "Driver from ai_profiler" or "Amiable from test_profiles"]  
- Confidence: High / Medium / Low  
- Why this match: (based on tone, values, structure, vocabulary...)  

**üß† Behavioral Insight**  
- Key traits this person demonstrates  
- Emotional triggers likely to resonate  
- Likely decision-making style  
- Cognitive biases at play (from profile or inferred)

**üéØ Strategy**  
- Best tone to use (direct / polite / storytelling / confident / humble...)  
- What to emphasize (logic, urgency, safety, credibility, feeling understood...)  
- What to avoid  
- If sales: best channel, frequency, subject line style

**‚úâÔ∏è Suggested Response**  
A natural, 100% human-sounding message you would send as a reply ‚Äî short, tailored, and aligned with the match.

**üìò Notes on Alignment**  
- How the message aligns with the identified profile  
- Why this approach is likely to succeed  
- If multiple profiles were combined, how and why  
- If sales tactics were incorporated, which ones and how they were applied
