import { createSystem } from '@chakra-ui/react';

// Create a basic system configuration
export const system = createSystem();

// For theming in Chakra UI v3, you can use the default theme
// or extend it as needed. The theme is now handled differently
// and is more modular. You can customize components, colors,
// and other theme tokens through the system configuration.
