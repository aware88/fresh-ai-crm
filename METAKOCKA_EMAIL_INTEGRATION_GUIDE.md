# Metakocka Customer Info Integration in Email Interface

## Overview

I've implemented a seamless integration that displays Metakocka customer information directly in your email interface. When viewing emails, you'll now see relevant customer data from your Metakocka system right in the email header.

## 🎯 Perfect Placement

The `CustomerInfoWidget` appears in the email detail view, positioned right after the email metadata (From, To, Subject, Date). This placement ensures you see customer context immediately when opening any email.

## 📊 Customer Information Displayed

### Basic Info
- **Customer Name & Email**: Clear identification
- **Status Badge**: Active/Inactive status with color coding
- **Order Count**: Total number of orders placed
- **Last Order Date**: When they last purchased (with smart formatting like "2 days ago", "3 months ago")

### Value Metrics
- **Total Customer Value**: Sum of all orders (€)
- **Average Order Value**: Helps understand spending patterns
- **Customer Insights**: Smart recommendations based on order history

### Order Timeline (Expandable)
- **Recent Orders**: Last 5 orders with visual timeline
- **Order Status**: Color-coded status indicators (delivered, shipped, pending, etc.)
- **Order Details**: Date, value, and item summary
- **Visual Timeline**: Connected dots showing order progression

## 🎨 Modern Design Features

### Visual Design
- **Gradient Background**: Blue-to-indigo gradient for modern look
- **Color-Coded Status**: Green for delivered, blue for shipped, etc.
- **Expandable Interface**: Click to show/hide detailed order timeline
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes

### Smart Insights
- **Customer Segmentation**: Automatically categorizes customers (new, regular, loyal)
- **Re-engagement Alerts**: Warns if customer hasn't ordered in 90+ days
- **Value-based Recommendations**: Suggests approach based on customer value

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Components
- **CustomerInfoWidget**: Main component displaying customer data
- **EmailDetail**: Enhanced to include customer widget

### Features

- **Caching**: Avoids repeated API calls for same customer
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if Metakocka unavailable

## 📍 Where You'll See It

   - Shows when viewing individual emails
   - Positioned after email headers

2. **Email Body Right Side**

## 💡 Business Benefits
