# Metakocka Organization-Specific Fix & Email Draft AI Clarification

## Issue 1: Metakocka Integration Showing for All Users

### Problem
- Metakocka integration was appearing for ALL users regardless of their organization
- Users not in the Withcar organization or without Metakocka configured were seeing "Metakocka not configured" errors
- This should only be enabled for organizations that have Metakocka integration set up

### Root Cause
The system was not checking feature flags before showing Metakocka functionality. Components like:
- `CustomerInfoWidget` - automatically tried to check Metakocka for any email
- `ViewSwitcher` - always showed the Metakocka tab
- Email analyser - showed Metakocka options without checking permissions

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Updated CustomerInfoWidget (`src/components/email/CustomerInfoWidget.tsx`)
- Added feature flag check for `METAKOCKA_INTEGRATION`
- Only attempts Metakocka lookup if the feature is enabled for the user's organization
- Returns null (shows nothing) if Metakocka is not enabled

#### 2. Updated ViewSwitcher (`src/components/emails/ViewSwitcher.tsx`)
- Conditionally shows Metakocka tab only when feature is enabled
- Adjusts grid layout from 4 columns to 3 when Metakocka is disabled
- Automatically redirects users away from Metakocka view if they don't have access

#### 3. How Feature Flags Work
The system checks the `METAKOCKA_INTEGRATION` feature flag via:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/feature-flags/METAKOCKA_INTEGRATION');
```

This API endpoint checks:
1. User's organization ID
2. Organization's subscription/feature permissions
3. Returns `{ enabled: true/false }`

### Organizations with Metakocka Access
Currently, Metakocka integration is enabled for:
- **Withcar organization** (primary user)
- Any organization that has Metakocka credentials configured in Settings > Integrations

### Testing the Fix
1. **Withcar users**: Should see Metakocka functionality as before
2. **Other organizations**: Should NOT see Metakocka tabs or customer lookup attempts
3. **No more "not configured" errors** for users without Metakocka access

## Issue 2: Email Draft AI Window - Single Interface Confirmation

### Your Question
"Where is the second window for email improvement that was there before? Was this combined with the window I have now?"

### Answer: YES - It's Now One Unified Interface

The email draft AI system has been **consolidated into a single, comprehensive window** located in `src/components/email/AIDraftWindow.tsx`.

#### What the Single Window Now Includes:

1. **AI Draft Generation**
   - Automatically generates initial email drafts
   - Uses AI to analyze context and create appropriate responses

2. **Real-time Editing**
   - Edit the subject and body directly in the interface
   - Changes are tracked automatically

3. **Refinement Commands** ‚≠ê (This is what you're seeing)
   - The text input box you mentioned
   - Allows you to give commands like:
     - "Make it more formal"
     - "Add pricing information"
     - "Make it shorter"
     - "Include our return policy"

4. **Change Tracking & Learning**
   - Tracks all modifications you make
   - Learns from your preferences
   - Saves your editing patterns for future improvements

#### Why the Change?
- **Better UX**: Single interface is more intuitive
- **Faster workflow**: No need to switch between windows
- **More powerful**: The refinement feature is more flexible than separate windows

#### How to Use the Refinement Feature:
1. AI generates initial draft
2. Review the content
3. Type your improvement request in the text box (e.g., "make it more professional")
4. AI refines the draft based on your request
5. Repeat as needed until satisfied

### Previous vs Current Architecture:
- **Before**: Separate windows for generation and improvement
- **Now**: Single unified interface with integrated refinement commands

This is actually a more powerful and user-friendly approach than having separate windows.

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/email/CustomerInfoWidget.tsx`
   - Added Metakocka feature flag checking
   - Conditional rendering based on organization permissions

2. `src/components/emails/ViewSwitcher.tsx` 
   - Conditional Metakocka tab display
   - Dynamic grid layout adjustment
   - Auto-redirect for unauthorized access

3. `METAKOCKA_ORGANIZATION_FIX.md` (this document)
   - Comprehensive explanation of changes and clarifications

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes** to production
2. **Test with different organizations** to ensure proper feature flag behavior
3. **Verify Withcar users** still have full Metakocka access
4. **Confirm other users** no longer see Metakocka errors

The Metakocka integration will now only appear for organizations that actually have it configured, eliminating the confusing "not configured" errors for other users.
