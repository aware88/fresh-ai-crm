# üö® URGENT: Manual RLS Fix Required

## The Problem
The Supabase linter is showing errors because RLS is not enabled on these tables:
- `email_content_cache`
- `email_index`
- `email_threads`

Our scripts have created the policies but cannot enable RLS due to limitations with the `exec_sql` RPC function.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Manual Steps

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor**

### Step 2: Run This SQL Query
Copy and paste this ENTIRE query into the SQL editor and run it:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all email tables
ALTER TABLE public.email_content_cache ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.email_index ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.email_threads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.emails ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.email_accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify it worked
SELECT 
  tablename, 
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE p.tablename = t.tablename AND p.schemaname = 'public') as policy_count
FROM pg_tables t
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('email_content_cache', 'email_index', 'email_threads', 'emails', 'email_accounts')
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Step 3: Expected Result
After running the query, you should see:
```
tablename           | rls_enabled | policy_count
--------------------|-------------|-------------
email_accounts      | t           | 3
email_content_cache | t           | 3
email_index         | t           | 3
email_threads       | t           | 3
emails              | t           | 3
```

All tables should show `rls_enabled = t` (true) and `policy_count = 3`.

### Step 4: Verify in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to **Database** ‚Üí **Tables**
2. Click on each email table
3. Check that "RLS enabled" shows as **ON**
4. Go to **Database** ‚Üí **Policies** to see all policies

## Why This Manual Step is Needed

The `exec_sql` RPC function we use in scripts has limitations with certain DDL commands like `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. This is a known limitation in Supabase when using RPC functions.

## Security Model After Fix

Once RLS is enabled, the security model will be:
1. **Service role** (API routes) - Full access ‚úÖ
2. **Anon role** - No access ‚ùå
3. **Authenticated role** - No access ‚ùå (we use NextAuth, not Supabase Auth)

All email access goes through API routes that validate NextAuth sessions.

## Alternative: Using Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI installed:
```bash
supabase db push --db-url "${DATABASE_URL}"
```

But the manual SQL method above is simpler and more reliable.

## After Applying the Fix

1. The Supabase linter errors will disappear
2. Your email functionality will continue to work
3. The security model will be properly enforced

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure you're running the SQL as a database admin
2. Check that all tables exist before running the ALTER commands
3. If a table doesn't exist, skip that ALTER command
