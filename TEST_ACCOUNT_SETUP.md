- The account setup is idempotent - running multiple times won't create duplicates

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Fails**: Ensure the user was created successfully in auth.users
2. **No Emails Visible**: Check email_accounts and email_index tables
3. **Subscription Issues**: Verify organization has 'pro' tier and 'active' status
4. **AI Analysis Not Working**: Check if ai_messages limit is properly set

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check test user
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Check test organization
SELECT * FROM public.organizations WHERE name = 'Test Organization';

-- Check mock emails
SELECT subject, sender_email, importance FROM public.email_index 
WHERE organization_id = (SELECT id FROM public.organizations WHERE name = 'Test Organization');

-- Check subscription status
SELECT subscription_tier, subscription_status, subscription_metadata 
FROM public.organizations WHERE name = 'Test Organization';
```
