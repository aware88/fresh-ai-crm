### **ðŸ”§ Phase 5 Components Created**

**Core Service:**
- `QualityAssuranceService.ts` - Comprehensive quality monitoring and improvement

**Frontend Components:**
- `QualityDashboard.tsx` - Complete quality assurance interface with alerts, insights, and metrics

**Backend APIs:**
- `/api/email/learning/quality` - Quality metrics, alerts, and improvement actions

**Database Schema:**
- `pattern_feedback_log` - Detailed feedback tracking for pattern improvement

### **ðŸŽ¯ Quality Assurance Features**

**1. Quality Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
Overall Quality = 
  Pattern Quality (30%) +     // Confidence, success rates, content quality
  Draft Quality (25%) +       // Average confidence, non-fallback rate  
  User Satisfaction (30%) +   // Approval rates, edit similarity
  System Performance (15%)    // Cache hits, cost efficiency
```

**2. Alert Types**
- **Pattern Degradation**: When patterns perform below threshold
- **Low Satisfaction**: When users frequently edit/reject drafts
- **Cost Spikes**: When AI costs increase unexpectedly
- **Performance Issues**: When cache hit rates or response times decline

**3. Auto-improvement Actions**
- **Pattern Optimization**: Adjust confidence scores based on feedback
- **Pattern Disabling**: Remove consistently poor performers
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Optimize system parameters automatically
- **Recommendation Generation**: Suggest specific improvements

**4. Advanced Analytics**
- **Edit Similarity Tracking**: Understand how users modify drafts
- **Pattern Effectiveness Scoring**: Measure real-world pattern success
- **Quality Degradation Detection**: Proactive quality monitoring
- **Cost vs Quality Analysis**: Optimize the balance between cost and quality
