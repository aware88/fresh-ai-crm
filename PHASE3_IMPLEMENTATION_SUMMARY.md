- **Escalation Logic**: Automatic escalation when approval timeouts occur
- **Cost Optimization**: AI model selection based on complexity and budget constraints

### **Automation Engine Features**
```typescript
// Example automation rule
{
  trigger_conditions: {
    days_overdue: 2,
    priority_levels: ["high", "urgent"],
    recipient_patterns: ["@enterprise-client.com"],
    time_of_day: "09:00",
    days_of_week: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] // Weekdays only
  },
  automation_settings: {
    auto_generate_draft: true,
    auto_send: false, // Requires approval
    require_approval: true,
