# Security Enhancements for Fresh AI CRM

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented for the Fresh AI CRM platform to improve overall security posture and meet compliance requirements.

## 1. Security Headers

Implemented comprehensive security headers via middleware to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Forces browsers to use HTTPS
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information in requests
- **Permissions-Policy**: Limits browser feature usage

## 2. Rate Limiting

Implemented Redis-based rate limiting to protect against abuse and brute force attacks:

- Stricter limits for sensitive endpoints (auth, admin, webhooks, payments)
- More lenient limits for general API endpoints
- IP-based and path-based rate limiting
- Proper headers to inform clients about rate limits

## 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Implemented TOTP-based two-factor authentication:

- Database schema with proper security controls
- Row-Level Security policies to protect 2FA data
- Secure backup code generation and management
- QR code generation for easy setup
- Comprehensive audit logging of 2FA events
- User-friendly setup flow with backup codes

## 4. Audit Logging

Enhanced audit logging capabilities:

- Comprehensive database schema for audit logs
- Row-Level Security policies to protect audit data
- Automatic triggers for important tables
- API endpoints for retrieving and filtering logs
- Admin dashboard for viewing and managing logs

## 5. Security Best Practices

- Immutable audit logs (no updates or deletes allowed)
- Strict access controls based on user roles
- IP address and user agent tracking for security events
- Secure database functions with security definer
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Installation Requirements

To enable these security features, the following dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
npm install @upstash/redis otplib qrcode
```

## Configuration

### Redis Configuration

For rate limiting to work properly, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-redis-url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-redis-token
```

### Security Headers

The security headers are configured in `src/middleware.ts`. You may need to adjust the Content Security Policy based on your specific requirements and third-party integrations.

## Next Steps

1. Implement end-to-end tests for security features
2. Add SMS-based two-factor authentication as an alternative
3. Implement IP-based anomaly detection
4. Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
5. Create a security incident response plan
