## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the version number.

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in CRM Mind, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. Please follow these steps to report a security issue:

1. **Email Us**: Send an email to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com) with the details of the vulnerability.

2. **Include the following information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any proof-of-concept code or exploit scripts
   - Impact of the vulnerability
   - Any mitigations if known

3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will aim to send a more detailed response to your report within 72 hours.

4. **Public Disclosure**: We will work with you to determine the appropriate time to publicly disclose the vulnerability after it has been fixed.

### Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we may offer rewards for significant security reports at our discretion.

## Security Updates and Alerts

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always keep your dependencies up to date
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly backup your data
- Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning user permissions

### For Developers

- Never commit sensitive information to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow the principle of least privilege for database users
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting and request validation
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## Security Measures in the Codebase

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Secure cookie settings
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Data Protection

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Secure password reset flows
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, etc.)

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency footprint

## Security Audit

We conduct regular security audits of our codebase and dependencies. If you would like to conduct a security audit, please contact us at [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com) to coordinate.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure guidelines:

1. **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability before we've had time to address it
2. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before making any information public
3. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and interruption or degradation of our service
