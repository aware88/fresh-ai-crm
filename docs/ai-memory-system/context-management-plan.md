# Context Management & Advanced Retrieval (Phase 5)

## Overview
Phase 5 of the AI Memory System focuses on enhancing memory retrieval and context management to improve the relevance and effectiveness of AI responses. This phase builds on the foundation of the Memory Summarization Service to create a more intelligent and context-aware memory system.

## Key Components

### 1. Dynamic Context Window Management
- Intelligently select which memories to include in limited context windows
- Prioritize memories based on recency, relevance, and importance
- Compress memory content to fit more information in context windows

### 2. Advanced Memory Retrieval
- Implement hybrid search combining vector similarity with keyword search
- Add temporal weighting to prioritize more recent memories when appropriate
- Create a context-aware retrieval system that adapts to conversation state

### 3. Memory Chains & Reasoning
- Connect related memories across time to form coherent chains
- Generate reasoning paths that explain how memories relate to current context
- Resolve contradictions between conflicting memories

### 4. Memory Importance Scoring
- Score memory importance based on multiple factors:
  - Usage frequency
  - Recency
  - User feedback
  - Relationship density
  - Outcome correlation

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Design & Database Updates
- Design the context management system architecture
- Update database schema for memory importance scoring
- Create API endpoints for context window management

### Week 2: Core Implementation
- Implement the dynamic context window manager
- Develop the hybrid search algorithm
- Create the memory importance scoring system

### Week 3: Integration & Testing
- Integrate with existing Sales Agent Core
- Develop comprehensive test suite
- Create documentation and usage examples

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Response Quality**: More relevant memories in context will lead to better AI responses
2. **Reduced Token Usage**: Smart context management will optimize token usage
3. **Better Reasoning**: Memory chains will enable more coherent reasoning
4. **Enhanced Personalization**: Importance scoring will prioritize the most valuable memories

## Success Metrics

- **Relevance Score**: Measure the relevance of retrieved memories to current context
- **Context Efficiency**: Ratio of useful information to context window size
- **Response Quality**: User ratings of AI response quality
- **Token Efficiency**: Reduction in token usage while maintaining quality
