# Database Fixes - July 7, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `user_preferences` Table
- **Problem**: The application was trying to access a `user_preferences` table that didn't exist in the database.
- **Solution**: Created the `user_preferences` table with appropriate columns, RLS policies, triggers, and functions.
- **Migration File**: `src/lib/supabase/migrations/20250706_user_preferences/user_preferences.sql`

### 2. Infinite Recursion in Organization Members RLS Policies
- **Problem**: The RLS policies for the `organization_members` table were causing infinite recursion.
- **Solution**: Replaced the recursive policies with non-recursive ones using EXISTS subqueries.
- **Migration File**: `src/lib/supabase/migrations/20250706_fix_organization_members_policy/fix_organization_members_policy.sql`
- **Note**: Had to update references from `owner_id` to `created_by` to match the actual schema of the `organizations` table.

## Verification Steps

After applying these migrations, we verified:
1. The `user_preferences` table exists and has the correct structure
2. The RLS policies for `organization_members` are correctly applied
3. The application can now load emails without infinite recursion or missing relation errors

## Future Improvements

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Implement a Migration System**
   - Set up a proper migration system to track and apply database changes
   - Consider using tools like Prisma, TypeORM, or a custom migration runner

2. **Add Database Schema Tests**
   - Create tests that verify the existence of required tables and columns
   - Add tests for RLS policies to ensure they work as expected

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Enhance error handling in the application to provide more meaningful error messages
   - Add specific error handling for database-related issues
