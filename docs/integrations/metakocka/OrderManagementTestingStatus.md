# Metakocka Order Management Testing Status

## Current Testing Status (July 1, 2025)

### Implemented Test Infrastructure

1. **Test Scripts**:
   - `order-management-test.js`: Comprehensive test script for order management integration
   - `manual-order-test.js`: Simplified script for manual API testing

2. **Shell Runners**:
   - `run-order-management-test.sh`: Main test runner with environment handling
   - `run-manual-order-test.sh`: Runner for manual API tests

3. **Documentation**:
   - `OrderManagement.md`: Comprehensive documentation of the integration
   - `order-management-test-plan.md`: Detailed test plan with UI and API approaches

### Issues Encountered

1. **API Authentication**:
   - API endpoints return HTML instead of JSON responses
   - Authentication tokens not being properly accepted
   - Development server running but not handling API requests correctly

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Basic environment variables configured in `.env.local`
   - Additional configuration may be needed for proper API access

### Next Steps for Testing

1. **Authentication Resolution**:
   - Obtain valid authentication token via browser login
   - Update test scripts with proper authentication approach

2. **Alternative Testing Approaches**:
   - Consider UI-based testing through browser automation
   - Use browser developer tools to capture working request patterns

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Review server logs for specific error messages
   - Identify any missing environment variables

### Test Coverage To Complete

1. Order creation and sync to Metakocka
2. Order status management
3. Order fulfillment workflow
4. Order cancellation workflow
5. Syncing orders from Metakocka to CRM

## Conclusion

The order management integration is fully implemented with backend services, API endpoints, and UI components. Testing infrastructure is in place but encountering authentication/environment issues that need to be resolved before comprehensive testing can proceed.
