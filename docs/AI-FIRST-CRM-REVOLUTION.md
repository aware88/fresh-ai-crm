## 🎯 The Problem: Traditional CRMs Are Broken

### Current State (Traditional CRM):
```
User Journey for Simple Workflow:
1. Login → Navigate to Suppliers page
2. Click "Add Supplier" → Fill 12 form fields manually
3. Navigate to Products page → Click "Add Product"
4. Fill 15 form fields → Manually link to supplier
5. Navigate to Orders page → Search for customer
6. Create order → Manually add products one by one
7. Navigate to Reports page → Generate reports manually

⏱️ Time: 15-20 minutes for simple workflow
🖱️ Clicks: 50+ clicks across multiple pages
🧠 Cognitive Load: HIGH (users must remember where everything is)
📚 Training: Weeks of training required
❌ Error Rate: High due to manual data entry
```

### The Result:
- **Frustrated users** who avoid using the CRM
- **Incomplete data** due to complex workflows
- **Lost productivity** from navigating multiple interfaces
- **High training costs** for new employees
- **Poor user adoption** leading to failed implementations
