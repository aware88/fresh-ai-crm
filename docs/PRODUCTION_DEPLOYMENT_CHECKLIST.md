## ðŸš€ Deployment Process

### Step 1: Final Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
npm run validate-system

# Check production readiness
npm run test:production-ready --verbose

# Run all tests
npm run test:ai-agents --verbose
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
# Test all functionality
# Verify integrations
# Load test the system
```

### Step 3: Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
# Monitor deployment logs
# Verify health checks
# Test critical paths
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Check system health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health?check=detailed

# Verify security
curl https://your-domain.com/api/security?action=stats

# Test AI agents
curl https://your-domain.com/api/test?format=json
```

## ðŸ”§ Available Testing Commands
