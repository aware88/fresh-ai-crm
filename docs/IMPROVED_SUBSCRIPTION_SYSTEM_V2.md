### **Smart Features**
- **FIFO Usage**: First purchased, first used
- **Automatic Detection**: System uses top-ups when subscription limits exceeded
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on usage patterns
- **1-Year Expiry**: Top-ups don't expire for 12 months

## 🎯 **Premium Tier Detection**

### **Automatic Recommendations**
The system analyzes:
- Current team size and growth rate
- Monthly AI message usage patterns
- Peak usage frequency
- Cost optimization opportunities

### **Recommendation Logic**
- **Basic**: 1-20 users, up to 5K messages/month
- **Advanced**: 20-50 users, 5K-15K messages/month  
- **Enterprise**: 50+ users, 15K+ messages/month or unlimited needs

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Tables Created**
1. `ai_usage_tracking` - Individual usage records with token tracking
2. `ai_usage_monthly_summary` - Aggregated monthly data
3. `ai_topup_packages` - Available top-up packages
4. `ai_topup_purchases` - Purchased top-ups per organization
5. `ai_topup_usage` - Usage tracking for top-up consumption

### **Services Implemented**
1. **AIUsageService** - Usage tracking and limit enforcement
2. **TopUpService** - Top-up purchase and consumption management
3. **PremiumTierService** - Tier recommendations and comparisons
4. **FeatureFlagService** - Feature access control
5. **Enhanced Middleware** - Seamless top-up integration

### **API Endpoints Created**
```
/api/topup/packages - Available top-up packages
/api/topup/balance - Organization's top-up balance
/api/topup/purchase - Purchase and history management
/api/topup/recommend - Personalized recommendations
/api/premium/recommend - Premium tier suggestions
/api/usage/status - Comprehensive usage status
/api/usage/dashboard-v2 - Enhanced dashboard with all features
```

## 🎨 **Premium Tier Detection Logic**

### **How It Works**
1. **Analyze Metrics**: Team size, usage patterns, growth rate
2. **Calculate Fit Score**: 0-100 score for each tier
3. **Generate Recommendations**: Pros/cons, cost analysis, migration path
4. **Project Growth**: 3, 6, 12-month usage projections

### **Smart Recommendations**
- **High Growth Teams**: Recommends higher tiers proactively
- **Peak Usage**: Detects irregular usage spikes
- **Cost Optimization**: Compares top-up costs vs plan upgrades
- **Feature Gaps**: Identifies missing features holding teams back

## 📊 **Dashboard Integration**

### **Enhanced Dashboard Features**
- **Real-time Usage**: Subscription + top-up balance combined
- **Smart Alerts**: Usage warnings, top-up recommendations, upgrade suggestions
- **Cost Insights**: Monthly spending, projected costs, savings opportunities
- **Growth Analytics**: Usage trends, team growth patterns
- **Action Items**: Direct links to purchase top-ups or upgrade plans

### **Alert System**
- **🟢 Healthy**: Under 70% usage, no issues
- **🟡 Warning**: 70-90% usage or using top-ups
- **🔴 Critical**: 90%+ usage or low top-up balance
- **⚫ Blocked**: No messages available

## 🔄 **Migration & Beta Users**

### **Existing User Benefits**
- All current users flagged as "beta early adopters"
- Special pricing locked in when upgrading
- Grandfathered into beneficial limits
- Smooth transition to new system

### **Migration Strategy**
