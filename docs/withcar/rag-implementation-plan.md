# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for connecting the RAG component with real data sources and AI services. The RAG system enhances email responses by retrieving relevant information from knowledge sources to provide context for AI-generated responses.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   - Ingests documents from various sources
   - Processes text for embedding generation
   - Stores documents and embeddings in vector database

2. **Vector Database**
   - Stores document embeddings for semantic search
   - Supports efficient similarity search
   - Maintains metadata for retrieved documents

3. **Embedding Service**
   - Generates vector embeddings for documents and queries
   - Ensures consistent embedding space for retrieval

4. **Retrieval Service**
   - Performs semantic search against vector database
   - Ranks and filters results by relevance
   - Returns most relevant document chunks

5. **Generation Service**
   - Uses retrieved documents to enhance LLM context
   - Generates responses based on email content and retrieved information

6. **Backend API Routes**
   - `/api/rag/process`: Process email content and retrieve relevant information
   - `/api/rag/sources`: Manage knowledge sources
   - `/api/rag/feedback`: Collect feedback on RAG results

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

Create a service that:
- Splits documents into manageable chunks
- Generates embeddings for each chunk
- Stores documents and embeddings in the database
- Handles different document types (emails, FAQs, knowledge base articles)

### 2. Vector Database Schema

```sql
-- Enable pgvector extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

-- Documents table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rag_documents (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Document chunks table with vector embeddings
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rag_document_chunks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES rag_documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  embedding vector(1536) NOT NULL, -- Dimension depends on embedding model
  chunk_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create index for vector similarity search
CREATE INDEX rag_document_chunks_embedding_idx ON rag_document_chunks USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);

-- Add RLS policies for multi-tenant isolation
ALTER TABLE rag_documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE rag_document_chunks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 3. Embedding Service

Implement a service that:
- Connects to OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API
- Generates embeddings for document chunks and queries
- Handles rate limiting and error cases
- Provides caching for frequently used embeddings

### 4. Retrieval Service

Implement a service that:
- Takes a query and converts it to an embedding
- Performs vector similarity search in the database
- Filters results based on metadata (source type, date range, etc.)
- Returns ranked results with relevance scores

### 5. Generation Service

Implement a service that:
- Takes email content and retrieved documents
- Formats them into a prompt for an LLM
- Calls the LLM API to generate a response
- Post-processes the response for quality and relevance

### 6. Backend API Routes

Implement API routes for:
- Processing email content to retrieve relevant information
- Managing knowledge sources (add, update, delete)
- Collecting feedback on RAG results for continuous improvement

### 7. Update UI Component

Update the existing `EmailRAGProcessor` component to:
- Call the real API endpoints
- Display retrieved information with proper formatting
- Show relevance scores and source metadata
- Allow users to expand/collapse document chunks
- Generate AI responses using the retrieved context

## Knowledge Source Types

### 1. Email Archives

Process previous email conversations to provide context from past interactions:
- Index important email threads
- Extract key information from email bodies
- Preserve metadata like sender, date, and subject

### 2. FAQ Documents

Process FAQ documents to provide quick answers to common questions:
- Structure as question-answer pairs
- Categorize by topic
- Link to full documentation when available

### 3. Knowledge Base Articles

Process internal knowledge base articles:
- Extract key sections and concepts
- Preserve article structure and hierarchy
- Include metadata like author, date, and category

### 4. Product Documentation

Process product documentation:
- Focus on specifications, features, and troubleshooting
- Link to product IDs in the database
- Include version information

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test document processing functions
   - Test embedding generation
   - Test retrieval functions
   - Test response generation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test end-to-end RAG pipeline
   - Test with various document types
   - Test with different query types

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Test retrieval speed with large document collections
   - Test embedding generation throughput
   - Test response generation latency

## Deployment Checklist

## Requirements from Client

To implement this RAG system, we need the following from the client:

1. **API Access**:
   - OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI endpoint and key
   - Access to any existing knowledge bases or document repositories

2. **Content Sources**:
   - Sample FAQ documents
   - Access to email archives (if applicable)
   - Product documentation
   - Knowledge base articles

3. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Preferred LLM model for response generation
   - Maximum response time requirements
   - Any specific formatting or style guidelines for AI responses

## Implementation Timeline

Once we receive the required access and resources:

- **Week 1**: Set up vector database and implement document processing pipeline
- **Week 2**: Implement embedding and retrieval services
- **Week 3**: Implement generation service and API routes
- **Week 4**: Update UI components and integrate with backend
- **Week 5**: Testing, optimization, and documentation
