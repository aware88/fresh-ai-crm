# AI Email Preferences System

## Overview

The AI Email Preferences System allows users to configure email handling preferences through natural conversation with AI. This system ensures that **ALL AI agents and analysis** throughout the platform respect user-defined preferences, creating a personalized and consistent experience.

## üéØ Key Features

### Conversational Setup
- **Natural Language Configuration**: Users can set preferences by talking to AI
- **Intelligent Understanding**: AI converts requests into structured rules
- **Real-time Application**: Preferences are immediately applied to the system
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI provides helpful configuration recommendations

### Email Processing Control
- **Email Filtering**: Skip or prioritize emails based on content, sender, or type
- **Routing Rules**: Automatically escalate or route emails to human review
- **Exclusion Lists**: Completely exclude certain emails from AI processing
- **Content Customization**: Modify response content based on email context

### Style & Behavior
- **Response Styles**: Professional, friendly, formal, casual, technical
- **Tone Control**: Helpful, direct, empathetic, enthusiastic, cautious
- **Length Preferences**: Brief, optimal, detailed, comprehensive
- **Global Instructions**: Custom instructions that apply to all AI interactions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AIPreferencesService** (`src/lib/ai/ai-preferences-service.ts`)
   - Central service used by ALL AI systems
   - Determines if emails should be processed
   - Provides AI instructions based on user preferences
   - Caches preferences for performance

2. **AIEmailPreferencesChat** (`src/components/email/AIEmailPreferencesChat.tsx`)
   - Conversational interface for setting preferences
   - Real-time chat with AI assistant
   - Visual preview of preference effects
   - Manual approval system for suggested changes

3. **Database Schema** (`user_ai_email_preferences`)
   - Structured storage of user preferences
   - JSONB fields for flexible rule definitions
   - Full audit trail and versioning
   - Row-level security for data protection

### Integration Points

The system integrates with **ALL** existing AI processing:

- **Email Analysis**: Respects filtering and exclusion rules
- **Response Generation**: Applies style and content preferences
- **Agent System**: All agents check preferences before processing
- **Queue Processing**: Preferences determine processing priority
- **Hub Service**: Central AI hub enforces all preference rules

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Option A: Use the automated setup script (Recommended)
node scripts/setup-ai-preferences.js

# Option B: Manual database migration
psql -d your_database -f sql-migrations/create-ai-email-preferences-table.sql
```

### 2. Restart Application

The system is automatically active once the database migration is complete. No additional configuration required.

### 3. User Access

Users can access the system at `/settings/email-ai` in the "Conversational Setup" section.

## üí¨ Usage Examples

### Setting Up Email Filters

```
User: "Don't send AI responses to promotional emails"

AI: I'll create a filter to skip promotional emails. This will:
‚Ä¢ Skip AI processing for emails with promotional keywords
‚Ä¢ Prevent automatic responses to marketing emails

[Apply Settings] button appears
```

### Configuring Response Style

```
User: "Use a friendly tone for customer support emails"

AI: I'll set up friendly responses for customer support. This will:
‚Ä¢ Use conversational, warm language
‚Ä¢ Maintain helpfulness while being approachable

[Apply Settings] button appears
```

### Setting Exclusion Rules

```
User: "Never process emails from competitors automatically"

AI: I'll exclude competitor emails from AI processing. This will:
‚Ä¢ Flag emails from competitor domains for manual review
‚Ä¢ Ensure sensitive communications get human attention

[Apply Settings] button appears
```

### Priority Handling

```
User: "Mark all urgent emails as high priority"

AI: I'll set up urgency detection. This will:
‚Ä¢ Detect urgent keywords (urgent, ASAP, emergency)
‚Ä¢ Process urgent emails immediately
‚Ä¢ Escalate for faster human review if needed

[Apply Settings] button appears
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### How Preferences Are Applied

1. **Email Received** ‚Üí System processes incoming email
2. **Preference Check** ‚Üí `aiPreferencesService.shouldProcessEmail()` is called
3. **Decision Made** ‚Üí System determines: process, skip, or escalate
4. **Instructions Applied** ‚Üí If processing, AI gets custom instructions
5. **Response Generated** ‚Üí AI follows user's style and content preferences

### Key Functions

```typescript
// Check if email should be processed (CRITICAL - called by all AI systems)
const decision = await aiPreferencesService.shouldProcessEmail(userId, emailContext);

// Get AI instructions for processing
const instructions = await aiPreferencesService.getAIInstructions(userId, emailContext);

// Save preferences from chat conversation
await aiPreferencesService.savePreferencesFromChat(userId, preferences, message);
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **5-minute caching** of user preferences
- **Indexed JSONB queries** for rule matching
- **Lazy loading** of preferences service
- **Background processing** for complex rule evaluation

## üìä Preference Types

### Email Filters
```json
{
  "id": "filter1",
  "name": "Skip promotional emails",
  "condition": "subject_contains_any(['promotional', 'sale', 'discount'])",
  "action": "skip_ai_processing",
  "description": "Don't process promotional emails with AI",
  "active": true
}
```

### Response Rules
```json
{
  "id": "rule1",
  "name": "High priority urgent emails",
  "trigger": "subject_contains(['urgent', 'ASAP'])",
  "behavior": "high_priority_processing",
  "custom_instructions": "Process immediately and include urgency in response",
  "escalate_to_human": true,
  "active": true
}
```

### Exclusion Rules
```json
{
  "id": "excl1",
  "name": "No AI for competitor emails",
  "condition": "sender_domain_in(['competitor1.com', 'competitor2.com'])",
  "action": "flag_for_manual_review",

}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

- **User Adoption**: Percentage of users with custom preferences
- **Performance Impact**: Processing time impact of preference evaluation

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/email/ai-preferences/stats` - User preference statistics
- `POST /api/email/ai-preferences-chat` - Conversational preference setup
- `POST /api/email/ai-preferences/apply` - Manual preference application

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Preferences Not Applied**
   - Check if user has active preferences: `aiPreferencesService.getUserPreferences(userId)`
   - Verify preference rules are correctly formatted
   - Check AI processing logs for preference application

2. **Chat Not Working**
   - Ensure OpenAI API key is configured
   - Check network connectivity to API endpoints
   - Verify user authentication session

3. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure migration was run successfully
   - Check RLS policies are correctly applied
