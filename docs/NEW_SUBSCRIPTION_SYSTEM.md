## Next Steps for Landing Page

The backend is now ready for the new pricing structure. For the landing page, you'll need:

2. **Emphasize value propositions**:
   - Starter: "Always Free" with unlimited contacts
   - Pro: "Most Popular" with full AI features
   - Premium: "Enterprise" with unlimited usage
3. **Feature comparison table** showing clear upgrade path
4. **Usage-based messaging** about AI message limits
5. **Beta user callouts** for special pricing

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
npm run test:subscription-system

This tests all components of the new system including usage tracking, limit enforcement, and feature flags.
